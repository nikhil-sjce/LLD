# 🏗️ Frontend Application Architecture

**(Turbo + Vite + React + TypeScript + Vitest)**

---

## 1️⃣ One-Line Overview (Start with this)

> “The application is a modular, TypeScript-first React frontend built using Vite for fast builds, Turbo for monorepo task orchestration, and Vitest for testing. The architecture emphasizes separation of concerns, scalability, and developer productivity.”

---

## 2️⃣ High-Level Architecture Diagram (Explain Verbally)

```
Monorepo (Turbo)
│
├── apps/
│   └── web/          → React + Vite application
│
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/           → Shared UI components
│   ├── utils/        → Common utilities
│   ├── config/       → Shared TS / ESLint configs
│   └── api-client/   → API layer (optional)
│
└── turbo.json        → Task pipeline
```

---

## 3️⃣ Why Turbo? (Monorepo Layer)

### What Turbo Does

* Orchestrates **build / test / lint**
* Caches tasks
* Runs tasks in parallel

### How You Explain

> “Turbo is used to manage the monorepo efficiently. It ensures only affected apps and packages are rebuilt or tested, which keeps CI and local development fast.”

---

## 4️⃣ Web App Architecture (Vite + React)

```
apps/web/
│
├── src/
│   ├── components/     → Reusable UI components
│   ├── pages/          → Route-level components
│   ├── hooks/          → Custom hooks
│   ├── services/       → API & business logic
│   ├── store/          → State management
│   ├── utils/          → Helpers
│   ├── styles/         → Global styles
│   ├── tests/          → Component & unit tests
│   ├── main.tsx
│   └── App.tsx
│
├── vite.config.ts
└── tsconfig.json
```

---

## 5️⃣ Why Vite? (Build Layer)

### Responsibilities

* Dev server
* Bundling
* HMR

### How to Say It

> “Vite provides extremely fast cold starts and hot module replacement by leveraging native ES modules. This improves developer experience significantly compared to traditional bundlers.”

---

## 6️⃣ Component Architecture (React)

### Pattern Used

* **Functional components**
* **Hooks-based logic**
* **Composition over inheritance**

```
Component
├── UI (JSX)
├── Hooks (logic)
└── Styles
```

### Example Explanation

> “Each component focuses on rendering and delegates logic to hooks, making components predictable and testable.”

---

## 7️⃣ State Management Strategy

### Levels of State

| Type         | Solution                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Local        | `useState`, `useReducer`      |
| Shared UI    | Context + custom hooks        |
| Server state | React Query / custom services |

### Interview Line

> “State is scoped to the lowest possible level. Context is used only where global access is required.”

---

## 8️⃣ API / Business Logic Layer

```
services/
├── apiClient.ts
├── userService.ts
└── authService.ts
```

### Why Separate?

* Avoids fat components
* Improves testability
* Easier mocking

> “Components never call APIs directly; they depend on service functions.”

---

## 9️⃣ TypeScript Strategy

### Key Principles

* Strict typing
* Shared types across packages
* Interfaces for contracts

> “TypeScript enforces contracts between components, services, and APIs, reducing runtime bugs.”

---

## 🔟 Testing Architecture (Vitest)

```
tests/
├── unit/
├── components/
└── hooks/
```

### What Vitest Tests

* Business logic
* Hooks
* Components

> “Vitest integrates seamlessly with Vite, providing fast, Jest-like testing with minimal configuration.”

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Turbo + Testing Flow

```
turbo run test
│
├── utils tests
├── ui tests
└── web tests
```

> “Turbo runs tests only for impacted packages, saving CI time.”

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ Build & Deployment Flow

```
Developer
→ Vite Dev Server
→ Turbo Build
→ CI Cache
→ Production Bundle
```

---

## 1️⃣3️⃣ Non-Functional Concerns

| Concern         | Solution                    |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| Performance     | Code splitting, memoization |
| Scalability     | Monorepo + shared packages  |
| Maintainability | Clear folder boundaries     |
| DX              | Vite + Turbo                |
| Testability     | Vitest + isolated logic     |

---

## 1️⃣4️⃣ Final Interview Closing Statement (Important)

> “This architecture allows us to scale teams and features independently, ensures fast feedback loops for developers, and keeps the codebase maintainable through clear separation of concerns.”
